You could put wildcards in this directory, sure.

But I can tell you're a refined individual and would never do anything so crass as put user data in a potentially volatile plugin directory! Haha, who would do that?

Instead, you can configure wildcard paths in `ComfyUI/extra_model_paths.yaml`:

```yaml
my_wildcards:
  wildcards: D:/dev/wildcards

# Or multiple sources:
another_set:
  wildcards: /home/user/shared/wildcards
```

Or just symlink your wildcards directory to `./wildcards` if you're lazy.

OR you can set the `LUMI_WILDCARDS_PATH` environment variable to point to your wildcards directory.
